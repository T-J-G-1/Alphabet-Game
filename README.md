This little game was made because my 2 year old wanted to play with the nice letters on the keyboard all the time.

It is basically a game in which a person has to press the correct letter, which will then cause the screen to flash
green and a new letter will be displayed. If the wrong letter is pressed then the screen will turn red and the letter 
will not change.

I added an easy and hard difficulty. On easy mode it doesnt matter if the letter is a capital or not, just pressing
the correct letter will count as a pass. On hard then if the letter is a capital you have to use a capital letter. 
The code itself takes a random letter from a list and checks user input to see if it matches.

As this was a little thing made with a small child in mind i have not added a scoring system or a timer (though i 
feel one could be added easily enough). I am hoping to add sound effects at some point.
